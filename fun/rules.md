Below are five fundamental rules that govern this dark fantasy world. Each rule is crafted to be internally consistent, specific enough to create interesting constraints, yet broad enough to invite creative interpretation:

1. The Corrupting Abyss
 • All supernatural power in the realm is drawn from an ancient, sentient source known simply as the Abyss. Every spell, ritual, or supernatural feat channels a fragment of this dark energy. However, using this power exacts a personal cost: each act accrues Corruption Points that slowly erode the user's body, mind, or soul.  
 • This rule forces magic-users and beings alike to weigh the benefits of power against the risk of irreversible transformation or madness, creating morally charged dilemmas and a tangible, often unpredictable, measure of risk.

2. The Price of Power
 • In this world, every extraordinary achievement—be it casting forbidden spells, forging potent magical artifacts, or unlocking hidden abilities—requires a sacrifice. This could be a drop of one’s lifeblood, the surrender of cherished memories, or even the betrayal of a loved one.  
 • By mandating that power has an inherent cost, this rule introduces a constant trade-off: the more one pushes the boundaries of forbidden knowledge, the steeper the sacrifice, ensuring a rich field of narrative tension, ethical ambiguity, and evolving character arcs.

3. The Binding Threads of Fate
 • Destiny in this realm is not a fluid, free-form concept but a tapestry woven by eldritch forces beyond mortal comprehension. Each being is bound to a predestined path—revealed through obscure prophecies or bloodline omens—but free will remains a fickle, dangerous luxury.  
 • While characters can make their own choices, every deviation carries unintended consequences that ripple throughout the world, enforcing a logical consistency where fate and free will clash in dramatic, inevitable ways.

4. The Dominion of Eternal Twilight
 • The natural order is subverted here; daylight is fleeting, and night reigns almost uninterrupted. The environment itself is steeped in supernatural gloom, with broken cycles of seasons, cursed lunar phases that amplify dark powers, and landscapes twisted by the energies of the Abyss.  
 • This ambient rule doesn’t just affect aesthetics—it imposes practical constraints on travel, combat, and survival. Characters must adapt to a world where light sources may repel or attract unseen horrors and natural phenomena can drastically alter the balance of power.

5. The Web of Shadowed Allegiances
 • Powerful entities—from ancient demons and capricious gods to clandestine covens and spectral aristocracies—are enmeshed in a complex, often hidden network of pacts, rivalries, and mutual obligations. Every bond made or broken has ramifications that can reverberate through the web, altering alliances and inciting conflict.  
 • This rule ensures that political intrigue and supernatural diplomacy are ever-present. Actions taken by a lone sorcerer or an insurgent noble might trigger ancient vendettas or invite unexpected allies, making the world feel alive and interconnected.

Together, these five rules establish a dark fantasy system where power is potent but perilous, fate is as binding as it is mutable, the environment itself is a character, and every action is woven into a tapestry of shadowed consequences. This framework invites players and storytellers to explore richly layered narratives full of tension, sacrifice, and a constant struggle against corruption.
